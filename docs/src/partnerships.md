# Key Partnerships

Element Facemap was developed in collaboration with Hui Chen Lu's Lab at Indiana
University Bloomington. 

Our team also works with the [Facemap developers](https://github.com/MouseLand/facemap) to promote
integration and interoperability between Facemap and the DataJoint Element Facemap.
